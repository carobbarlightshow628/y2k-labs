Title: I built a skill that turns any document into a full Azure DevOps backlog — Epics, Features, Stories, Tasks with hierarchy

Body:
I was tired of spending hours manually creating work items from PRDs, so I built po-skills — a set of 4 agent skills that automate the entire Product Owner workflow in Azure DevOps.

What it does:
- Reads any document (PRD, spec, meeting notes) and creates the full backlog hierarchy
- Audits your existing backlog and gives it a health score (0-100)
- Plans sprints based on actual velocity and dependencies
- Generates standard work items from 18 templates (API endpoint, CRUD, auth, CI/CD...)

One command: npx po-skills -g

Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, and 40+ AI agents.

GitHub: https://github.com/GusY2K/po-skills
npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/po-skills

Would love feedback from anyone working with Azure DevOps!

Title: Open-source AI tool that reads your PRD and creates the full backlog in Azure DevOps (Epics → Features → Stories → Tasks)

Body:
As a Product Owner, I was spending 2-3 hours per sprint manually creating work items from requirements documents. So I built an agent skill that does it automatically.

You give it a document, it:
1. Extracts the hierarchy (Epics, Features, User Stories, Tasks, Bugs)
2. Shows you the plan before touching anything
3. Creates everything in Azure DevOps with parent-child links
4. Verifies the hierarchy is correct

Also includes:
- Backlog health auditor (scores your backlog 0-100)
- Sprint planner (velocity-based)
- 18 work item templates

Uses az boards CLI under the hood. Open source, Apache 2.0.
